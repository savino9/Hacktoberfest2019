## Hi DEV friends! 
## Welcome to this Open source, beginner-friendly repository that is gonna help you with your first pull-request 

__Ready for a brand new limited edition T-shirt from Digital Ocean?__

Well, all you need to do is:

- Register to: [hacktoberfest2019](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

**Before we run into nerdy stuff I want to say thank you for all your contributions!**

Alright, let's get starded.

First thing first:

- clone or fork this project [simple guide how to clone/fork projects from Github](https://www.stevejgordon.co.uk/forking-cloning-github)

- Add your name + surname to the __CONTRIBUTING.md__ file

- You must edit one of the two file that I've created (__I_LOVE_CODE.json__) or (__PROGRAMMERS_BEST_FRIEND.json__)

* What's a [.json](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file?

Example:

- __I_LOVE_CODE.json__ it's a JSON file where you need to write your programmer nickname and the reason why you love coding 

```json
{
  nickname: "savino9",
  IloveCode: "it's super fun!"
}
```

- __PROGRAMMERS_BEST_FRIEND.json__ it's another JSON file in here you'll say what's your favourite web dev tool AND/OR your favourite text-editor

```json
{
  nickname: "savino9",
  MybestFriends: ["Google Chrome DevTools", "Terminal", "Visual Studio"]
}
```

 __Happy hacking!__
