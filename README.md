## Hi DEV friends! 
## Welcome to this Open source, beginner-friendly repository that is gonna help you with your first pull-request 

__Ready for a brand new limited edition T-shirt from Digital Ocean?__

Well, all you need to do is:

- Register to: [link to hacktoberfest2019](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

- Make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone).

**Before we run into nerdy stuff I want to say thank you for all your contributions!**

Alright, let's get starded.

First thing first:

- Clone or fork this project [simple guide how to clone/fork projects from Github](https://www.stevejgordon.co.uk/forking-cloning-github)

- Add your name + surname to the __CONTRIBUTING.md__ file

- You must edit one of the two file that I've created (__I_LOVE_CODE.json__) or (__PROGRAMMERS_BEST_FRIEND.json__)

* What's a [.json](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) file?

Example:

- __I_LOVE_CODE.json__ it's a JSON file where you need to write your programmer nickname and the reason why you love coding 

```json
{
  nickname: "savino9",
  IloveCode: "it's super fun!"
},
```

You can litterally copy the all block of code and just change "savino9" with your nick and "it's super fun!" with your reason why, then paste it in a new line after the last comma.

Another example just to be 100% sure :)

```json
{
  nickname: "savino9",
  IloveCode: "it's super fun!"
},
{
  nickname: "example1",
  IloveCode: "it gives me superpower!"
},
```

- __PROGRAMMERS_BEST_FRIEND.json__ it's another JSON file in here you'll say what's your favourite web dev tool AND/OR your favourite text-editor

```json
{
  nickname: "savino9",
  MybestFriends: ["Google Chrome DevTools", "Terminal", "Visual Studio"]
},
{
  nickname: "example1",
  MybestFriends: ["Atom", "Sublime", "Postman"]
},
```
